OTHER_FILES DIRECTORY
================

In other_files/ there are files which are  apparently not directly linked to the ecdfo algorithm : they may be tests (*temp*), copies of SMOP translated code (*automatic*) or others :
bcdfo_solve_TR_MS - Kopie seems to be only a copie of bcdfo_solve_TR_MS (surely bugged?)
funlist contains a list of functions,
generalUnittest is the basic code for a unit test,
bcdfo_find_new_yj_bc.m is the equivalent of bcdfo_find_new_yj when there are bound constraints but it does not seem to be called,
ecdfo_augmX_evalf_fromrepository and bcdfo_solve_TR_MS_bc_decorator not sure yet what they are intended for. 
bcdfo_checkZ was a factorization of code which was not present in the matlab code and not totally equivalent, therefore not necessary.
bcdfo_computeP_hand_test contains some tests of computeP
ecdfo_solve_TR_bc_dave is apparently Dave's older version of ecdfo_solve_TR_bc if we refer to the date of the latests commits messages
