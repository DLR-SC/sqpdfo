SMOP_TO_USE
================

This is the translation tool used to convert matlab code to python code. How to use it is explained in the README.rst file in the 'smop' repository, for instance :    
   $ python main.py file_to_translate.m
   or :
   $ python main.py otherfiles/*
   and the translation will be written in the 'a.py' file.
   
There are also 2 runtime files :
runtime_with_matlabarray.py and runtime_without_matlabarray as well as their respective comment_on_translation file to explain the main problem for each translation.
Translating with matlabarray is normally easier but may lead the program to run slower in the end.
