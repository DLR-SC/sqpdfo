SQPDFO Optimizer
================

This is a python implementation of the SQPDFO Optimizer.
This is working quite fine, though there remain a few bugs : more slight bugs have been fixed in the implementation withouth matlabarray which have not been reported on this version. But I prefer to keep this version close just in case.
Unfortunately, implementing it so with matlabarrrays make it so that some big problems, when functions are called thousands of times, are running very slow.
