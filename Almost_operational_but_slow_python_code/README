SQPDFO Optimizer
================

This is a python implementation of the SQPDFO Optimizer.
This is working quite fine, though there no doubts remains a few bugs (since we can not simply make exhaustive tests) but thoses remaining bugs should be easy to fix with the file
Comments_on_translation or a little bit of modifications in the runtime.py (hopefully no difficult bugs remain)
Unfortunately, implementing it so with matlabarrrays make it so that some big problems, when functions are called thousands of times, are running very slow.
