SQPDFO Optimizer
================

This is a python implementation of the SQPDFO Optimizer which works using normal python arrays.
A few bugs may remain but it is mainly functional.

All the tests can be ran using the script 'runTests.py'.

To add some functions, you have to :
-add the function by following other examples in ecdfo_init_prob and ecdfo_func
-change'set_prob('name_or_number_of_function')' in run_ecdfo
-finally launch run_ecdfo
